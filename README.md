# W-9 Crafter

If you are a contractor or do freelancing or something in the United States, you'll probably be asked for a W-9 at some point.

I got annoyed with having to fill it out every time I was asked.

Now, here is a solution: a button.

## How to use this

- Download this repository or clone it
- Fill out the [Form W-9](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw9.pdf) with everything except for the date
- Make sure Rust and Cargo are installed
- Run `cargo tauri dev`
- Point to your filled-out W-9 form
- Click the button whenever you want a W-9
- Be free, at last
