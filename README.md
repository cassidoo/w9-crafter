# Form W-9 Crafter

If you are a contractor or do freelancing or something in the United States, you'll probably be asked for a W-9 at some point.

I got annoyed with having to fill it out every time I was asked.

Now, here is a solution: a button.

## How to use this

- Download this repository or clone it
- Fill out the form `fw9-blank.pdf` with everything except for the date and save it as `fw9-filled.pdf`
- `npm install` and then `npm start`
- Click the button whenever you want a W-9
- Be free, at last
