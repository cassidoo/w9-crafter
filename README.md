# W-9 Crafter ðŸŒ³

If you are a contractor or do freelancing or something in the United States, you'll probably be asked for a W-9 at some point.

I got annoyed with having to fill it out every time I was asked.

Now, here is a solution: a button.

## Buying the app

Yes, this app is open source and you can run it to your heart's content. But, it'd be reeeeally cool if you bought the final product and supported a lil indie dev like me!
